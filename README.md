# EurekAlert RSS generator

This is a command-line utility to crawl the current [EurekAlert news releases
pages](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/browse/all) and then convert
everything to RSS.

I use this in a cronjob on my VPS to maintain [an EurekAlert RSS
feed](https://cpbotha.net/feeds/eurekalert/rss.xml) that I can follow with my reader.

You're welcome to use the feed or this code.
